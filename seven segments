This assembly code initializes the 8255 chip and then continuously displays the digit 8 on the output. Let's break down each part:

1. `ASSUME CS:CODE`: Assumes that the code segment (`CS`) is `CODE`.

2. `START:`: Marks the start of the code section.

3. `MOV DX, 06H`: Moves the value `06H` into the `DX` register, which is the port address for the 8255 chip.

4. `MOV AL, 80H`: Moves the value `80H` into the `AL` register, which is the control word to initialize the 8255 chip.

5. `OUT DX, AX`: Outputs the contents of the `AX` register (which holds `80H`) to the port specified by `DX`, initializing the 8255 chip.

6. `MOV DX, 00H`: Moves the value `00H` into the `DX` register, which is the port address for output.

7. `MOV AL, 7FH`: Moves the value `7FH` into the `AL` register, which represents the digit 8 in ASCII.

8. `OUT DX, AL`: Outputs the contents of the `AL` register (which holds `7FH`) to the port specified by `DX`, displaying the digit 8.

9. `ENDLESS: JMP ENDLESS`: Creates an infinite loop, causing the program to continuously display the digit 8.

10. `CODE ENDS`: Marks the end of the code section.

11. `END START`: Marks the end of the program, specifying that the program execution should start at the `START` label.
